#CovidDataExporation.sql-- This demonstrates my ability to import data into SQL and query data to make observations based off the data and move those queries into views,Temp Tables, or CTE's to later reach for when creating visualizations.

#main.py-- This is a webscraping script in python used to take the player data of all Milwaukee Brewers players and export it into a csv file. 

Power BI Project-- In this I demonstrate my ability to transform data within power query by removing columns, replacing values, and creating functions. I then visualize the data by creating multiple charts and graphs to show the data in a manner that anyone can read.
